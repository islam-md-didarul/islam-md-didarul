## 👨‍💻 About Me  

I’m passionate about uncovering the **physics of fluid flows in biological and engineering systems** through the combined power of **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)** and hands-on experiments. Moreover, I am deeply motivated to explore the emerging fields of **Digital Twin and Medical Twin** technologies, utilizing my knowledge in fluid dynamics to connect simulation, AI, and Data-Driven methods for real-world applications. 

My research explores:  
- ⚙️ **Turbomachinery** – hydraulic performance optimization, cavitation and erosion studies, pump design improvements 
- 🔬 **Biofluids** – thrombin-induced clot formation in pseudoaneurysms, flow obstruction in ureteral models, airflow in upper airways
- 🧵 **Composite Materials** – design, synthesis, and evaluation of natural fiber reinforced composites, eco-friendly polymers, and additive manufacturing for biomedical applications
